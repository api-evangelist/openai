      The Assistants API allows you to build AI assistants within your own
      applications. An Assistant has instructions and can leverage models,
      tools, and knowledge to respond to user queries. The Assistants API
      currently supports three types of tools - Code Interpreter, Retrieval, and
      Function calling. In the future, we plan to release more OpenAI-built
      tools, and allow you to provide your own tools on our platform.
