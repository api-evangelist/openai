## APIs

### OpenAI Assistants API

The Assistants API allows you to build AI assistants within your own
applications. An Assistant has instructions and can leverage models,
tools, and knowledge to respond to user queries. The Assistants API
currently supports three types of tools - Code Interpreter, Retrieval, and
Function calling. In the future, we plan to release more OpenAI-built
tools, and allow you to provide your own tools on our platform.

### OpenAI Audio API

The Audio API provides two speech to text endpoints, transcriptions and
translations, based on our state-of-the-art open source large-v2 Whisper
model.

### OpenAI Chat API

Given a list of messages comprising a conversation, the model will return
a response., providing an AI chat interface you can use to engage with
users.

### OpenAI Chat Completions API

Chat models take a list of messages as input and return a model-generated
message as output. Although the chat format is designed to make multi-turn
conversations easy, it's just as useful for single-turn tasks without any
conversation.

### OpenAI Files API

Files are used to upload documents that can be used with features like
Assistants and Fine-tuning. Upload a file that can be used across various
endpoints. The size of all the files uploaded by one organization can be
up to 100 GB.

### OpenAI Fine Tuning API

Manage fine-tuning jobs to tailor a model to your specific training data.
Creates a fine-tuning job which begins the process of creating a new model
from a given dataset.Response includes details of the enqueued job
including job status and the name of the fine-tuned models once complete.

### OpenAI Images API

Learn how to generate or manipulate images with DALL_E in the API. The
Images API provides three methods for interacting with images - creating
images from scratch based on a text prompt, creating edited versions of
images by having the model replace some areas of a pre-existing image,
based on a new text prompt, Creating variations of an existing image.
